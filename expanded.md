### Case 1: French Reign of Terror (1793–1794)

## The French Reign of Terror (1793–1794)

The French Reign of Terror represents a pivotal moment in the development of modern state terrorism, emerging from the revolutionary crisis that engulfed France between 1793 and 1794. The Terror began officially on September 5, 1793, when the Convention decreed terror as the "order of the day" in response to mounting internal and external pressures threatening the Revolution's survival.¹

The context for the Terror's emergence was dire. France faced military disasters both abroad and in the domestic Vendée rebellion, while the Convention operated under intense pressure from radical factions and popular demonstrations. As Robespierre summarized the situation: "Eleven armies to lead, the weight of all Europe to bear, traitors to unmask everywhere, emissaries corrupted by the gold of foreign powers to outmaneuver."² The Revolutionary Tribunal was established on March 9, 1793, followed by the Committee of Public Safety on April 6, marking the institutional foundations of the Terror.

The Terror evolved through three distinct phases. The first phase culminated with the adoption of the "Law of Suspects" on September 17, 1793, which provided sweeping definitions allowing the elimination of all regime opponents.³ The second phase witnessed the systematic destruction of various political factions, including the execution of the Hébertistes in March 1794 and the Dantonists in April. The third and most intense phase began with the Law of 22 Prairial on June 10, 1794, which abolished remaining legal guarantees and accelerated executions dramatically.⁴

The Terror's implementation revealed its fundamentally arbitrary nature, with some regions like the Vendée suffering massive casualties while others remained largely untouched. This disparity demonstrated how terror operated through multiple levels of state apparatus, encouraging abuse of power among local authorities and promoting the mechanism's self-perpetuation.⁵ The system ultimately consumed its own architect when Robespierre was executed on July 28, 1794, ending the Terror's most violent phase.


### Background & Causes

## Background & Causes

The French Revolution of 1789 unleashed a cascade of crises that culminated in the Terror of 1793-1794. Political instability plagued France as revolutionary dynamics transformed the nation's governance structures. The Revolution "both launched the revolution in human rights and invented state terror in the name of virtue," creating fundamental tensions between liberty and order.¹

Foreign wars intensified France's precarious situation. By 1793, "France's military situation was disastrous, both abroad and at home in the Vendée." The Convention declared war on multiple European powers, including England, Holland, and Spain in the first quarter of 1793. French forces suffered defeats, notably at Neerwinden on March 16, while General Dumouriez's defection on April 1 further destabilized military command.²

Internal uprisings compounded these external pressures. The Vendée rebellion began on March 11, 1793, combining "the passions of civil war with the technology of classical warfare." Simultaneously, factional conflicts between Girondins and Jacobins reached a breaking point. The coup against the Gironde faction occurred on May 31, followed by demonstrations on June 2 that resulted in Girondin deputies being expelled from the Convention.³

Economic crisis provided the underlying foundation for political upheaval. Though specific details about inflation and food shortages are not extensively documented in the available sources, the broader context reveals a nation struggling with multiple simultaneous crises. As Robespierre summarized the situation in September 1793: "Eleven armies to lead, the weight of all Europe to bear, traitors to unmask everywhere, emissaries corrupted by the gold of foreign powers to outmaneuver, disloyal administrators to monitor and prosecute."⁴


### Legal & Social Status of Groups

## Legal & Social Status of Groups

During the French Revolution, the **Committee of Public Safety** emerged as the supreme legal authority, wielding unprecedented power over the revolutionary state. Established on April 6, 1793, this body was granted comprehensive control when the Convention decreed that "the provisional government of France shall remain revolutionary until peace is achieved," placing the Committee in charge of overseeing the entire state apparatus.¹ The Committee's authority became absolute following Saint-Just's October 10, 1793 decree creating an emergency regime, which suspended the Constitution and placed ministers and generals under Committee supervision.²

The **Jacobins**, particularly under Robespierre's leadership after his election to the Committee on July 27, 1793, systematically targeted specific groups as "enemies of the Republic." The primary victims included **royalists** (exemplified by the executions of Louis XVI on January 21, 1793, and Marie-Antoinette on October 16), **Girondins** (executed en masse on November 1, 1793), and **clergy** who refused to accept revolutionary changes.³ The Law of Suspects, adopted September 17, 1793, provided a broad definition allowing elimination of all regime opponents, while the Revolutionary Tribunal was reorganized to accelerate prosecutions dramatically—from 260 accused and 66 condemned to death initially, to 371 indictees and 177 death sentences between October and December 1793.⁴

The **Law of 22 Prairial** (June 10, 1794) marked the Terror's apex, denying accused persons legal counsel, allowing "moral proofs," limiting sentences to acquittal or death, and expanding treason to encompass virtually anyone. Section 6 of this law effectively made any opposition to the revolutionary government punishable by death.⁵ However, the **Thermidorian Reaction** following Robespierre's execution on July 28, 1794, fundamentally altered these institutions. The Terror's legal framework collapsed with its architect, as those who had previously supported it but feared Robespierre's absolute power orchestrated his downfall, ending the systematic persecution of designated enemy groups.⁶

## Where to Read

For comprehensive coverage of terrorism's historical development, two key works provide essential perspectives on the French Revolution's role in shaping modern concepts of terror and political violence.

**The History of Terrorism** by Gerard Chalian offers a dedicated chapter examining the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. Chalian argues that the Terror should be understood "as a phase of the French Revolution, rather than as the 'form of revolutionary politics'" and emphasizes how the Revolution "both launched the revolution in human rights and invented state terror in the name of virtue."¹ The work traces how the French Revolution marked a crucial turning point, giving birth to the term "terror" and prefiguring practices that would evolve considerably in the twentieth century with totalitarianism.² Chalian's analysis demonstrates how terror was implemented unevenly across France, with some regions like western cities bearing the brunt while others were largely spared, illustrating the arbitrary nature inherent in state terrorism.

**An Intellectual History of Terror** by Mikkel Thorup provides a broader examination of ideology, state power, and the justification of violence. Thorup's work represents "the first attempt at an intellectual history of terror, or rather of our legitimizations and de-legitimizations of political violence."³ The book explores how political language changes to understand what people are saying about violence, arguing that "we need to discount the notion that political violence can be speechless."⁴ Thorup's approach examines terrorism as one expression of violence among many, characterized not by specific qualities of violence but by the structural position of perpetrators and their ongoing interaction with state actors.

Both works complement each other by providing historical narrative alongside conceptual analysis of how terror became embedded in modern political discourse and practice.


### Case 2: Armenian Genocide (1915–1917)

## Case 2: Armenian Genocide (1915–1917)

The Armenian Genocide of 1915–1917 emerged from the intersection of Ottoman military defeats, demographic engineering policies, and the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP)'s pursuit of total control over state and society. The genocide cannot be separated from broader Ottoman demographic policies targeting multiple communities, including Greeks, Nestorians, Syrian Orthodox Christians, Circassians, and Druzes.¹

### Context and Escalation

Following Ottoman entry into World War I in October 1914, military disasters precipitated the targeting of Armenians. The Third Army's failed December 1914 offensive against Russia resulted in near-annihilation, with retreating irregular units and Muslim civilians beginning to plunder and massacre Armenian villages. By spring 1915, further defeats on multiple fronts, including the near-forcing of the Dardanelles on 18 March 1915, prompted the Ottoman government to prepare evacuating Constantinople.²

The immediate trigger came with Armenian resistance at Van in April 1915. Ottoman authorities prioritized eliminating this 'suspected internal foe' over combating Russians, attacking on 20 April 1915 and massacring surrounding villages. However, Armenian defenders defeated government forces, who withdrew on 17 May before Russian arrival. News of Van's defence, combined with expected Dardanelles attacks, prompted Talaat to order empire-wide arrests of Armenian community leaders on 24 April 1915.³

### Systematic Deportations

Initial deportations began with redirection of Zeitun Armenians to Der Zor. On 2 May 1915, the Ministry of War suggested deporting all Armenians from eastern border regions, with Muslim settlers immediately replacing them. Within a week, governors of Erzerum, Bitlis, and Van provinces received orders to deport Armenians toward the Syrian Desert and Mosul. By 23 May, deportations extended to historic Cilicia and Mosul border areas, with strict settlement restrictions: new Armenian villages must be at least twenty-five kilometres from railway lines, not exceed fifty households, and Armenians must never exceed ten percent of local Muslim populations.⁴

### Death Toll and Aftermath

Ottoman data suggests an Armenian population of at least 1,718,132 in 1914. By April 1917, only 284,157 Armenians remained in Ottoman records, with approximately 65,081 having escaped to Russian lines. This indicates over 1.1 million Armenians lost their lives due to government policies, with possibly more than 150,000 forcibly assimilated. These estimates, based on government data, do not cover losses in 1917-1918 and represent conservative figures.⁵


### Background & Causes

## Background & Causes

The Armenian Genocide occurred during the twilight of the Ottoman Empire, a period marked by profound territorial losses, economic decline, and rising nationalist tensions. By the early twentieth century, the empire faced mounting challenges that would ultimately contribute to the systematic destruction of its Armenian population.

### Late Ottoman Decline

The Ottoman Empire experienced severe territorial contraction throughout the nineteenth century, losing substantial European territories to nationalist movements and great power interventions. Following defeat by Russia, the 1878 Congress of Berlin forced the Sublime Porte to accept territorial losses and implement reforms, including improvements for Ottoman Armenians.¹ The empire's weakening was exacerbated by increasing foreign debt that led to bankruptcy and tightening European control over the tax basis, while Ottoman governments became increasingly dependent on European support in exchange for concessions and privileges to European nationals.²

During the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, a coalition of Balkan states defeated the Ottoman Empire, which lost Macedonia, Epirus, Kosovo, and Western Thrace. At least 339,074 Muslims fled to Ottoman-held territory, creating a massive refugee crisis that the unprepared government struggled to manage, with many refugees dying of starvation or disease.³ This influx of destitute Muslim refugees, many survivors of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, Caucasus, and Aegean regions, intensified competition for land and resources within the remaining Ottoman territories.

### WWI Context: Suspicion of Collaboration with Russia

World War I provided the crucial context for the genocide, particularly regarding Ottoman suspicions of Armenian collaboration with Russia. A secret military alliance with Germany gave the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) new political leverage, and in October 1914, the Ottoman government abrogated the 'Capitulations' that had granted foreign nationals immunity from Ottoman law.⁴ Following an Ottoman naval attack on Russian Black Sea ports on 29 October 1914, France, Britain, and Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire.

The CUP's suspicions of Armenian disloyalty intensified after military disasters. In December 1914, the Ottoman Third Army launched an offensive against Russia but was almost annihilated, with irregular units and fleeing Muslim civilians subsequently plundering and massacring Armenian villages during their retreat.⁵ The government's fears reached a crescendo with the Armenian defense of Van in April 1915, where Armenian defenders successfully resisted Ottoman forces until Russian troops arrived, confirming CUP suspicions about Armenian-Russian collaboration.

### Turkish Nationalism and the CUP

The Committee of Union and Progress emerged as the dominant political force following the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, which forced the weakened government to accept parliamentary rule after a severe economic crisis intensified social discontent.⁶ Initially, the revolution triggered intercommunal fraternizations, and Muslim and Armenian parties cooperated in parliament. However, a counter-revolution in April 1909 caused a significant setback, with massacres in Cilicia claiming 25,000 to 30,000 Armenian lives.

The CUP's nationalist ideology became increasingly radical, particularly after the Balkan Wars. The party coordinated systematic campaigns against Ottoman Greeks and Bulgarians, with party cadres and government officials organizing attacks along the Aegean littoral that resulted in the expulsion or deportation of hundreds of thousands of non-Turkish populations.⁷ The CUP's ultimate goal was the establishment of total control over state and society through demographic engineering that would create ethnically homogeneous Turkish-Muslim territories.


### Legal & Social Status

## Legal & Social Status

### Before WWI: Recognized Minority with Restrictions

Prior to the First World War, Armenians constituted a recognized minority within the Ottoman Empire, though subject to significant legal and social restrictions. Non-Muslims, including Greeks and Armenians, "had some autonomy in internal community affairs, while being subjected to discriminatory taxation and an inferior legal status."¹ Despite these limitations, Armenian communities "played critical roles in the Ottoman economy" and formed "a sizeable part of the empire's population" alongside other Christian communities.² The relationship between the state and Armenian communities was complex, with periods of cooperation—"Muslim and Armenian parties cooperated in parliament"—followed by increasing tensions, particularly after the 1909 counter-revolution when "Armenian demands for reform and the restitution of property met with new resistance."³

### During Genocide: "Traitors/Enemies" and Mass Deportations

The outbreak of World War I fundamentally transformed the legal status of Armenians from recognized minority to perceived internal enemy. Following Ottoman military defeats and the Armenian defense of Van in April 1915, "Talaat ordered the arrest of Armenian community leaders empire-wide on 24 April 1915," with police rounding up "journalists, clerics, politicians, and teachers" who were "sent to the interior where the majority was killed."⁴ The government systematically redefined Armenians as traitors requiring removal. On 27 May 1915, the Ottoman government issued "a 'provisional law' that gave Ottoman military commanders the right to deport anyone they wished to," followed by detailed implementation guidelines that revealed the deportations were "not a temporary emergency measure but should permanently change the demographic map."⁵ The legal framework for property confiscation followed, with regulations ensuring "Armenian owners had lost their property rights and could not object," as Talaat decreed "that the Ottoman economy had to become an exclusively Muslim one" and "Armenian property must fall into Muslim hands."⁶

### Aftermath: Near-Total Destruction of Armenian Presence

The systematic deportations and massacres resulted in the virtual elimination of Armenian communities from Anatolia. Government statistics indicate that of an estimated Armenian population of at least 1,718,132 in 1914, "over 1.1 million Armenians had lost their lives due to government policies" with "possibly more than 150,000 Armenians" forcibly assimilated.⁷ The few survivors faced devastating circumstances: "most survivors suffered from physical injuries, diseases, and psychological traumata" and "the remaining Armenians were a disintegrating fragment of their former community rather than resembling just a numerically reduced population."⁸ The post-war period offered little restoration, as "the international community sanctioned with the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 the realities created by the CUP during the Armenian genocide, and furthered the ethnic homogenization of Anatolia."⁹


### Where to read

## Where to Read

For comprehensive coverage of the Armenian Genocide, readers should consult **The Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies**, edited by Donald Bloxham and A. Dirk Moses. This authoritative volume contains a dedicated chapter on the Armenian Genocide that provides essential scholarly analysis of this pivotal case in genocide studies.

The *Oxford Handbook* represents a significant contribution to the field of genocide studies, which has emerged as a distinct academic discipline since the 1990s. The handbook's publication within Oxford University Press's history list reflects the editors' commitment to the "historicization" of genocide—embedding critical theories more firmly in empirical data through historically based, interdisciplinary methods.¹ This approach makes the genocide concept more useful to historians, social theorists, and scholars across various fields.

The Armenian Genocide chapter, authored by Hilmar Kaiser, examines the systematic deportation and extermination of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Kaiser's analysis demonstrates how the genocide developed within the context of wider Ottoman demographic policies and late Ottoman history, challenging earlier interpretations that assumed long-term genocidal planning.² Instead, recent scholarship reveals that the development of the war determined the timing of deportations and massacres, and that the genocide cannot be separated from demographic policies targeting other communities including Greeks, Nestorians, Syrian Orthodox Christians, Circassians, and Druzes.

The chapter provides crucial documentation of the systematic nature of the violence. Kaiser notes that the central authorities monitored deportations and maintained precise counts of deportees, while the loss of life caused by death marching, famine, diseases, and systematic massacres appears to have been part of the government's programme.³ The Ottoman authorities assigned deportees to settlement areas in thinly populated districts with limited arable land, where they were not to exceed ten percent of the Muslim population, creating an Armenian "surplus" population that could not be accommodated or assimilated.

The *Oxford Handbook* chapter also addresses the gendered dimensions of the Armenian Genocide, noting how perpetrators followed family-based patterns of destruction. When villages were attacked, men were murdered while surviving family members were raped, expelled, and killed, with perpetrators frequently engaging in inversion rituals and ritual desecrations targeting the spiritually sacred and biologically generative structures of family life.⁴


### Case 3: Argentina’s Dirty War (1976–1983)

# Case 3: Argentina's Dirty War (1976–1983)

Argentina's military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983, known as the "Process of National Reorganization" (Proceso de Reorganización Nacional), represented one of the most systematic campaigns of state terror in Latin American history. The regime emerged following a military coup that overthrew the civilian government amid escalating political violence and economic instability.¹

## Context and Ideology

The Argentine military believed they were fighting what they termed a "Third World War" against subversion, drawing inspiration from French counter-insurgency doctrine, particularly André Beaufre's strategic writings.² General Jorge Rafael Videla, who headed the military government during its most repressive years (1976-1980), articulated the regime's ideological framework: "Argentina is a Western and Christian country... It is to defend this Western and Christian condition as a way of life that this struggle has begun against those who have not accepted this way of life and have tried to impose a different one."³

The military's conception of the enemy extended far beyond armed guerrilla groups. As Videla explained, "A terrorist is not just someone who kills with a gun or a bomb, but anyone who spreads ideas that are contrary to Western and Christian civilization."⁴ This broad definition justified targeting intellectuals, political activists, students, and anyone deemed subversive to the established order.

## Systematic Nature of Repression

The regime's approach was deliberately systematic, designed not merely to defeat guerrilla forces but to fundamentally transform Argentine society. General Díaz Bessone, the Minister of Planning, outlined the regime's "National Project," emphasizing that "the armed forces must be sufficiently alert, determined and resourceful to act simultaneously as an efficient fighting force against guerrillas and terrorists; an efficient surgeon that will remove the evil from all social classes and walks of life."⁵ This "surgical" metaphor revealed the regime's intention to permanently eliminate perceived threats to their vision of Argentine society.

## Legal Recognition and Genocide Debate

In 2006, Argentine courts began recognizing these crimes as genocide. The Federal Criminal Oral Court No. 1 of La Plata sentenced Miguel Osvaldo Etchecolatz and Christian Von Wernich for "crimes against humanity within the framework of the genocide that occurred in Argentina between 1976 and 1983." The court determined that victims were targeted not as specific individuals but because "they belonged to certain communities, sectors or groups of the Argentine nation" that did not conform to the regime's predetermined model for society.⁶


### Background & Causes

## Background & Causes

The Argentine military coup of 1976 emerged from a complex interplay of domestic political crisis and Cold War anti-communist ideology. The immediate trigger was the deteriorating situation under Isabel Perón's government, which faced mounting challenges from both left-wing guerrilla groups and economic instability.^1

Two principal guerrilla organizations had emerged around 1970: the Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP) and the Movimiento Peronista Montonero (Montoneros). These groups engaged in high-profile kidnappings, assassinations, and bank robberies throughout the early 1970s. The ERP's activities included kidnapping business executives and securing substantial ransoms, such as the $14 million obtained for the head of the Argentine Esso affiliate. The Montoneros had earlier kidnapped and killed former president Pedro Aramburu in 1970.^2

The death of Juan Perón in 1974 precipitated an outbreak of extreme right-wing violence, spearheaded by the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA), which sought to establish a dictatorship. This chaotic situation, characterized by escalating violence from both guerrilla groups and right-wing paramilitaries, provided the military with the justification it needed to intervene.^3

The military coup was fundamentally driven by Cold War anti-communist ideology and the National Security Doctrine that had spread throughout Latin America. General Jorge Rafael Videla, who headed the military government, explicitly framed the intervention in ideological terms, declaring that Argentina was "a Western and Christian country" and that the struggle was "against those who have not accepted this way of life and have tried to impose a different one." The military defined terrorism broadly, encompassing not just armed actors but "anyone who spreads ideas that are contrary to Western and Christian civilization."^4

The guerrilla groups, while providing a convenient pretext for military intervention, represented a relatively small threat compared to the scale of the subsequent repression. The military's own analysis revealed that these insurgent forces never managed to control significant territory or command professional armies, lacking the basic conditions that military theorists consider necessary for actual warfare.^5


### Justification

The Argentine military junta's "National Reorganization Process" (Proceso de Reorganización Nacional) was systematically framed as a moral crusade to defend Western Christian civilization against subversive forces threatening the nation's fundamental values. General Jorge Rafael Videla, who headed the military government during its most repressive years (1976-1980), articulated this moral framework in explicit terms, declaring that "Argentina is a Western and Christian country" and that "it is to defend this Western and Christian condition as a way of life that this struggle has begun against those who have not accepted this way of life and have tried to impose a different one."^1^

This moral crusade extended beyond targeting armed guerrillas to encompass anyone deemed ideologically threatening to the established order. Videla clarified that persecution was not directed at individuals who merely "think differently," but rather at "the effects this might have on the way other members of society behaved." He expanded the definition of terrorism to include intellectual dissent, stating that "A terrorist is not just someone who kills with a gun or a bomb, but anyone who spreads ideas that are contrary to Western and Christian civilization."^2^

The regime's self-designation as a "Process of National Reorganization" reflected its ambitious goal of fundamentally transforming Argentine society. General Diaz Bessone, the Minister of Planning, outlined this transformative vision in his "National Project," arguing that the armed forces must act "as an efficient surgeon that will remove the evil from all social classes and walks of life" to create a "new republic." This surgical metaphor revealed the systematic nature of the campaign, targeting specific groups whose elimination would have an "irreversible" effect on Argentine society.^3^ The moral crusade thus served as ideological justification for what courts would later recognize as the systematic destruction of substantial portions of the Argentine national group.


### Legal & Social Status

## Legal & Social Status

The Argentine military junta that seized power in 1976 established de facto legal authority through what they termed the 'Proceso de Reorganización Nacional' (Process of National Reorganization). The regime was headed by a succession of military leaders, most notably General Jorge Rafael Videla, who governed during the worst years of repression between 1976 and 1980.¹ The junta justified its authority by claiming that "the country is passing through one of the most difficult periods in its history" and that "the intervention of the armed forces was the only possible alternative in the face of the deterioration provoked by misgovernment, corruption, and complacency."²

The victims of this systematic repression were primarily political dissidents, students, trade unionists, and members of neighbourhood associations who were perceived as threats to the military's vision of a "Western and Christian" Argentina.³ General Videla explicitly stated that "a terrorist is not just someone who kills with a gun or a bomb, but anyone who spreads ideas that are contrary to Western and Christian civilization."⁴ The regime targeted not specific individuals but entire social groups, with the aim being "the systematic destruction of trades unions, political parties, student groups" to achieve broader social transformation.⁵ Over 13,000 people officially disappeared or were murdered between 1974 and 1983, though human rights organizations estimate the total at 20,000-30,000 victims who were processed through a network of over 500 concentration camps.

In the aftermath, Argentina established truth commissions and pursued legal accountability through trials. Significantly, Argentine courts have recognized these crimes as genocide, with the Federal Criminal Oral Court No. 1 of La Plata sentencing perpetrators like Miguel Osvaldo Etchecolatz for "crimes against humanity within the framework of the genocide that occurred in Argentina between 1976 and 1983."⁶ However, the process has involved partial amnesties and ongoing legal debates about the appropriate classification of these systematic crimes against political groups.


### Where to read

## Where to Read: Reigns of Terror — Argentina

For comprehensive coverage of Argentina's reign of terror during the military dictatorship (1976-1983), several key academic sources provide detailed analysis of this period of state-sponsored violence.

*The Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies* offers extensive documentation of Argentina's systematic repression under the National Security Doctrine. The handbook details how Argentine military forces believed they were fighting a "Third World War" against subversion, implementing what they termed a "Process of National Reorganization."¹ The regime's approach was explicitly described by military leaders as requiring "surgery" to "remove the evil" from society, targeting not just armed guerrilla forces but conducting "clearly defined 'surgical operations' on previously defined sections of the population whose disappearance was meant to have an 'irreversible' effect on Argentinean society."²

The handbook provides crucial context for understanding Argentina's role in regional repression, noting that "in the late 1970s and early 1980s it was Argentina that had the dubious distinction of organizing repression and political intervention throughout the rest of Latin America." Argentine forces trained military personnel across the region in "counter-insurgency tactics, torture and the art of disappearing people," and even "designed and participated in the military coup in Bolivia in 1980."³

For theoretical frameworks understanding state terror, *The History of Terrorism* by Gerard Chalian provides valuable comparative analysis, examining how terror operates as a mechanism of state control and social transformation, drawing parallels between historical cases like the French Revolution and modern Latin American dictatorships.

These sources collectively offer essential reading for understanding Argentina's reign of terror within both its national context and broader patterns of state violence in twentieth-century Latin America.
